# Sales-Profit-Analysis-

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I recently worked on analyzing performance data for Annapurna Heritage Grocery Store in India. Using advanced BI tools, I developed a dashboard that highlights key performance metrics and reveals opportunities for growth. Here's a summary of the insights:

Key Highlights:
✅ Total Sales: $14.96M | Profit: $3.75M
✅ Top Customer: Krithika with $334.36K in purchases
✅ Best Categories: Eggs, Snacks, Food Grains, and Bakery, each generating ~$2.1M in sales.
✅ Underperforming Region: North region contributed only 0.01% of sales, signaling a need for targeted marketing.

Strategic Insights:
🔍 Seasonal Peaks: November saw the highest sales ($1.9M)—a great time for targeted campaigns.
🔍 Opportunities for Growth: Noodles, Chocolates, and Masalas are underperforming but have potential with better promotions.
🔍 Customer Loyalty: Top customers like Krithika and Verma are driving significant revenue, emphasizing the need for loyalty programs.

Recommendations;
1️⃣ Launch localized campaigns to address the North region's low performance.
2️⃣ Optimize high-performing sub-categories like Health Drinks and Soft Drinks.
3️⃣ Leverage seasonal sales with pre-holiday offers.

I designed and interpreted this dashboard using Power BI/Excel, transforming raw data into actionable business insights. This project underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing business strategies.
